# Intro

Hello,

My name is Anh Le, I am an aspiring Web Developer. I applied to Steezy's Full Stack JavaScript Engineer position a few days back and I would like to supplement my application by making two small suggestions to your website.

## Suggestions

On your features page, one of the image is covering a content text when the screen width is greater than 1700px.

I would suggests that you set the CSS so that the max-width in full-screen is 50%. Be sure to adjust the width to 100% in the media queries to keep your responsive displays.

The second suggestion is that you have a different "menu-window" image for phone screen displays.
